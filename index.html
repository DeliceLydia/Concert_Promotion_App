              <h5 class="strong red">
                American singer-songwriter, pianist, and actress
              </h5>
              <p>
                Alicia Keys was born in Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan, to Terria
                Joseph (née Teresa M. Augello), a paralegal who was also an
                occasional actress, and Craig Cook, a flight attendant. Her
                father is African-American and her mother, who is Caucasian, is
                of Italian and English/Irish/Scottish ancestry. Alicia began
                taking piano lessons at age 7 at her mother's insistence. She
                proved to be such a prodigy that she was later accepted into the
                prestigious Professional Performance Arts School of Manhattan,
                where she majored in choir. only her musical talent but also her
                grades proved to be so exceptional that she was allowed to
                graduate, as valedictorian, at age 16. In 1998, she signed with
                Arista Records, and wrote, produced, and recorded her own
                albums.

              <h5 class="strong red">Burundian singer-songwriter</h5>
              <p>
                Khadja Nin was born in 1959 and raised in Burundi, a small
                African country squeezed in between two gigantic territories,
                the Democratic Republic of Congo and Tanzania. She grew up
                peacefully in a family of eight children, where she made her
                first steps into music. “Music was always for fun“, she
                confesses, though she already wished to be Myriam Makeba. When
                she turned 16, she left her family and went to Congo to pursue
                her studies. At the age of 17, she met her future husband and
                moved with him into the forest, where they ran some lodges for
                tourists in search of big thrills. She also gave birth to her
                son and thought that for her music was definitely over.
